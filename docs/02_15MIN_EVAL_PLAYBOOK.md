# 15-minute evaluation playbook (pim–pam–pum)

## Minute 0–2: confirm the thesis
Read the top of the root `README.md`.
Look for: governance = admission control; Decision ≠ Log.

## Minute 2–6: verify evidence exists (not promises)
Open `08_EVIDENCE_PACK.md` and click:
- one human-readable report (.md),
- one machine snapshot (.json),
- one reviewable proposal (.csv) if present.

## Minute 6–10: seniority signals
Read `04_ARCHITECTURE_AND_INNOVATION.md`.
You should see:
- explicit trade-offs,
- failure modes,
- non-goals,
- role definitions (who owns what).

## Minute 10–15: integration realism
Skim:
- `07_INTEGRATION_PATTERNS.md`
- `05_THREAT_MODEL.md`

Optional: run demo steps (Windows CMD) from the underlying repos.
