# Capsule 2 — Product Posture (Bounded Authority)

This capsule demonstrates **day-to-day governed delivery**:
productive change without authority creep.

**Canonical document**  
→ `PRODUCT_POSTURE.md`

**Posture**
- Allowed: docs, examples, scripts, artifacts
- Forbidden: workflows, execution plane
- Contract: `DC-2026-001`

**What to evaluate**
- Bounded authority is enforced
- Drift is detected before escalation
- Decision debt accumulates explicitly

This README is an entry point only.
All architectural reasoning lives in the canonical document.
