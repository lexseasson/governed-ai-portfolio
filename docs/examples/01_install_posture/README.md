# Capsule 1 — Install Posture (Docs-only)

This capsule shows **ultra-minimal adoption** of governance:
docs-only changes, zero workflow or execution-plane impact.

**Canonical document**  
→ `INSTALL_POSTURE.md`

**Posture**
- Allowed: `docs/`, `artifacts/`
- Forbidden: workflows, engine, execution plane
- Contract: `DC-INSTALL-DEMO-001`

**What to evaluate**
- Docs-only changes are admitted
- Forbidden domains are blocked
- Artifacts are emitted even on failure

This README is an entry point only.
All reasoning lives in the canonical document.
