# Capsule 3 — Governance Evolution

This capsule demonstrates **self-governance of the control plane**:
when governance itself changes, it is treated as constitutional risk.

**Canonical description**  
→ See: `docs/examples/03_governance_evolution.md`

**Posture**
- Governance surfaces: `.github/workflows/`, `integrations/`, `adl/`, `pyproject.toml`, `tests/`
- Contract: `DC-REPO-001` (maintenance / constitutional)

**What to evaluate**
- Routing to maintenance posture is automatic and deterministic
- Audit trail records *route + reason*, not just outcome
- Governance weakening is classified as high-risk drift

This README is an entry point only.  
All architectural reasoning lives in the canonical document.
