# Hiring Manager TL;DR (90 seconds)

## What you are evaluating
A coherent set of repos demonstrating **decision systems + governance primitives**:
- decisions under uncertainty (quant),
- governance of change (control plane),
- decision admissibility (contracts + CI gates).

## Three falsifiable claims
1) **Signals don’t scale** without risk framing and reproducibility.  
2) **Agentic work fails** when meaning is overwritten and evidence is missing.  
3) **Logs are forensic; decisions are contractual** — admissibility must exist at commit-time.

## The three anchors
- Crypto Signals Ensemble → quantitative decision system baseline
- DevTracker Governance → evidence boundary + governance artifacts
- ADL → decision contracts + admissibility gates (Decision ≠ Log)

## What I explicitly do NOT claim
- “Autonomy is safe by default”
- “Observability equals governance”
- “We’ll reconstruct intent later”

## If this matches your pain
You operate systems where:
- audits happen after incidents,
- teams change over time,
- and reliability depends on controlling change, not only writing code.
